clingwrap [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/clingwrap.png)](http://badge.fury.io/js/clingwrap) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goodeggs/clingwrap.png)](https://travis-ci.org/goodeggs/clingwrap)
==============

Command line tool for predictable npm-shrinkwrap updates.  Tired of [unexpected changes to npm-shrinkwrap](https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/3581) when you just want to update a package?  Just `clingwrap foo-package`.

```sh
$ npm install -g clingwrap
```

```

  Usage: clingwrap <package ...>

  Commands:

    * <package>            Update shrinkwrapped tree for named package(s) to match local install
    npmbegone              Strip hardcoded npmjs.org urls from shrinkwrap for faster installs

  Options:

    -h, --help     output usage information
    -V, --version  output the version number

```

Examples:
--------

Add a new package:
``` sh
$ npm install underscore@1.5.0 --save
$ clingwrap underscore
> underscore 1.5.0
```

Update an exisiting package:
``` sh
 $ npm install underscore@1.6.0 --save
 $ clingwrap underscore
 > underscore 1.5.0 â†’ 1.6.0
```

Remove a package:
``` sh
 $ npm uninstall underscore --save
 $ clingwrap underscore
 > underscore removed
```
